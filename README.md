# WilsonPP
Wilson++ is an advanced, probabilistic uniform spanning tree and maze generation algorithm, inspired by the classical Wilson's algorithm. It improves upon the original algorithm by introducing multi-seed initialization, adaptive weighted random walks, dynamic loop retention, and hierarchical meta-cell refinement.
