Wilson++

Wilson++ is an advanced, multi-scale generalization of Wilson’s algorithm for generating spanning trees and maze structures. It introduces adaptive random walks, probabilistic loop retention, and hierarchical refinement to produce highly organic and self-organizing structures. The algorithm balances stochastic exploration with structural coherence, resulting in mazes that resemble naturally evolved networks rather than strictly uniform trees.

Overview

Classical Wilson’s algorithm generates uniform spanning trees using loop-erased random walks. While elegant, its uniformity often produces overly regular or homogeneous structures. Wilson++ extends this model by introducing controlled biases and hierarchical refinements that make the generation process context-aware, dynamic, and fractal in nature.

The algorithm begins with multiple seed nodes and grows the tree simultaneously from several regions. Each random walk is guided by adaptive probability weights that respond to the surrounding tree structure, walk history, and local connectivity. This adaptive system allows Wilson++ to balance randomness with order, generating complex structures that maintain both diversity and connectivity.

Key Features

1. Adaptive Weighted Random Walks
Each step in the random walk is influenced by the neighborhood’s state using three control parameters:

Alpha (α): penalizes steps near already-included tree nodes

Beta (β): discourages revisiting nodes in the current walk

Gamma (γ): encourages exploration of underconnected regions
This results in non-uniform exploration that naturally avoids redundant loops while maintaining structural balance.



2. Probabilistic Loop Retention
Unlike the strict loop-erasure in classical Wilson’s algorithm, Wilson++ dynamically decides whether to keep or erase a loop based on local complexity. The retention probability depends on the number of available neighbors, allowing the algorithm to occasionally preserve loops, leading to labyrinth-like, semi-cyclic formations.


3. Multi-Seed Initialization
Instead of a single root, Wilson++ initializes several seed cells proportional to the square root of the grid size. This accelerates convergence and allows for parallelized growth of independent substructures that eventually merge, reducing average runtime on large grids.


4. Hierarchical Meta-Cell Refinement
After the main tree is constructed, the algorithm performs multi-level refinement on localized cell clusters. Each level applies internal random reconnections within meta-cells of decreasing size, introducing fractal-like detail and local irregularity without breaking overall connectivity. This refinement produces visually and topologically rich mazes resembling organic systems such as root networks, city patterns, or neuronal clusters.



Complexity

Although the theoretical complexity remains close to that of Wilson’s original algorithm (O(N log N) in practice), Wilson++ improves empirical runtime through multi-seeding and reduces structural uniformity by introducing controlled local biases. The resulting structures are not strictly uniform spanning trees but approximate them with high entropy and realistic heterogeneity.

Implementation Notes

Wilson++ is implemented in Python for clarity and experimentation. The code is easily adaptable to other languages or frameworks. Key adjustable parameters include:

alpha, beta, gamma (control exploration and bias)

meta_cells (defines the granularity of hierarchical refinement)

levels (number of refinement layers)


The included ASCII renderer provides a textual visualization of generated mazes for quick inspection.

Installation

Wilson++ is implemented in pure Python and requires no external dependencies.
To install and run the algorithm locally:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
You can verify this by running the command:

python --version


2. Clone or download the repository containing the Wilson++ source code.
If using Git, run:

git clone https://github.com/<deyprabahan>/WilsonPP.git
cd WilsonPP


3. No additional setup is required. The algorithm can be executed directly from the command line:

python3 wilson_pp.py


4. To modify parameters such as grid size, random seed, or refinement levels, edit the configuration values inside the main section of the script:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    w, h = 20, 12
    maze = wilson_pp_advanced(w, h, seed=42, meta_cells=4, levels=2)
    print_maze(maze, w, h)



After execution, the algorithm will print an ASCII-rendered maze to the console.
For larger experiments or visualization, you can adapt the script to save data structures or integrate with graphical frameworks.

Applications

Wilson++ can be applied in a wide range of domains, including:

Procedural maze and level generation in games and simulations

Synthetic modeling of biological or urban growth patterns

Visualization of stochastic optimization and self-organizing systems

Research on biased random walks, spanning forests, and entropy-based network formation
